I have been working as a full-stack software engineer since January 2010.
Since then, I have had the privilege to work on PHP, Java and Node.js applications with a variety of data persistance mechanisms (PostgreSQL, Oracle RDBMS, CouchDB, MongoDB, and more).
As of late, I have been focusing on building performant and maintainable REST APIs using Node.js.

My path to software engineering was not direct.
I graduated high school with a passion for cars, and set my sights on automotive engineering.
After a year-long stint as a mechanic's apprentice for [Authohaus Pulz](http://bmw-partner.bmw.de/autohaus-pulz-riesa/de_DE/uebersicht.html), a BMW dealership in Riesa, Germany, I began Mechanical Engineering studies at the University of New Mexico.
My sophomore summer, I took an eight-month break to do an internship with the Exterior Performance team at Honda R&D in Raymond, Ohio.
During my short tenure at Honda, I applied recently learned Matlab and Visual Basic programming skills correlate objectively measured data to subjective scores from internal experts and
JD-Power consumer scores. One example is correlating JD-Power consumer scores for wind and road noise to measured sound levels.

Upon returning to the University of New Mexico, I took a research opportunity and also started working as a Teaching Assistant for *CS-151: Matlab Programming for Engineers*.
My passion for autos was still strong, and I took part in the Formula Society of Automotive Engineers engineer team. Twenty other students and I built an open wheeled race car to compete
against other universities from around the world.
Due to my passion for programming, I became the marketing liason, and oversaw our fund-raising efforts as well as maintained the team's website.

Upon graduation, I was offered a rare opportunity to try programming as my primary focus at the Mind Research Network.
There, I maintaned a PHP and Java web application for managing neuroimaging research data.
This was my first exposure to web application development, and I learned more in my first two years there than in four years of school.

Once I had a firm grasp of the fundamentals of web application development in PHP, I began to understand the limitations of the codebase behind our application.
This prompted me to lead efforts to refactor the code base, and eventually migrate it from PHP that renders HTML on the server to Node.js-powered REST APIs and a React web application.

After six wonderful years at MRN, I took another leap, and joined the fast-paced world of e-commerce at Walmartlabs.
Here, I am still workinig on performant Node.js-powered REST APIs and evangelizing for engineering best practices.
My focus has been on APIs to support native mobile applications, as well as the web pages for store information (e.g. https://www.walmart.com/store/100).

Since joining Walmartlabs, I have had the opportunity to work with many tallented engineers.
Let the learning never end!
