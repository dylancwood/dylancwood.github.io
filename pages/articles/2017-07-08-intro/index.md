This blog could take many forms.
As of right now, I have a few ideas for future posts, which I will list below.
I hope to eventually produce some content that is useful for others.
If nothing else, this will be a conspicuously public place for me to reflect on the technology that I work with.

Possible future articles:
1. Teaching a code-camp for kids:
I'm teaching a code camp for 10-13 year olds this summer, and am super nervous about it.
I hope to use my [own curriculum](https://github.com/dylancwood/codecamp)for teaching programming fundamentals, then jump straight in to the [nodebots](https://nodebots.io) nodeschool modules.
2. Writing a digital version of Set:
I love the card game called [Set](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1198/set).
I also know an 11-year-old who easily destroys me at Set every time.
I wrote a Node.js-powered [version of Set](https://github.com/dylancwood/set), and hope to use it as a way to teach said 11-year-old about programming.
2. Toolchain insights from Walmartlabs:
After running it by my superiors, I hope to write some articles on how we use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Hapi.js](http://hapijs.com), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and other tools at Walmartlabs.
3. Team insights from Walmartlabs:
As they say at [&yet](https://andyet.com/), "*Software is about people*".
It is also written by teams of people.
How these people interact plays a big role in the resulting product.
We have a wonderful team dynamic at Walmartlabs, and I look forward to sharing it with the world.
